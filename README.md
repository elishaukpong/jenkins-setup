# JENKINS SETUP USING DOCKER

This is a docker setup for jenkins installation.

You can create a pipeline from the blue ocean ui and paste in the 
contents of `Jenkinsfile` or you can upload it to the root of a repo and
connect your jenkins instance to the github repo and see how jenkins builds
the pipeline for that Jenkinfile.
